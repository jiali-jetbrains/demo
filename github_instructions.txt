To create a GitHub repository and push this project:

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Name the repository 'Demo'
4. Leave it as a public repository
5. Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have files)
6. Click 'Create repository'
7. Follow the instructions for 'push an existing repository from the command line':

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Demo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.
