# Why can't I see the repositories in my GitHub account?

If you've followed the instructions to create a GitHub repository but can't see it in your GitHub account, here are some possible reasons and solutions:

## Possible Reasons:

1. **You haven't pushed the repository to GitHub yet**
   - The repository exists only locally on your computer
   - You need to complete all the steps to push it to GitHub

2. **You're not logged into the correct GitHub account**
   - Make sure you're logged into the GitHub account where you created the repository

3. **The repository name might be different**
   - Check if you used a different name than 'Demo' when creating the repository

## How to Fix:

### Option 1: Use the provided script (Recommended)

1. Run the script from the project root directory:
   ```
   ./create_github_repo.sh
   ```
2. Follow the prompts in the script:
   - It will guide you to create a repository on GitHub
   - Enter your GitHub username when prompted
   - The script will push your code to GitHub

### Option 2: Manual steps

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Name the repository 'Demo'
4. Leave it as a public repository
5. Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have files)
6. Click 'Create repository'
7. Run these commands in your terminal:

   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Demo.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

8. After pushing, you can view your repository at: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Demo

## Verifying the Push:

After pushing, run this command to verify the remote repository is configured:
```
git remote -v
```

You should see something like:
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Demo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Demo.git (push)
```
